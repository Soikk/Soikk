### About me

I'm a software engineering student who is very familiar and enjoys working with C. I can also work with Java and C# with similar proficiency.  

My (most interesting) projects are: 
- [**DB**](https://github.com/Soikk/DB), a WIP local tag based database and database interface that allows you to relate files together with tags.
- [**neural-net**](https://github.com/Soikk/neural-net), a small implementation of a simple neural net with an example.
- [**pixel-count**](https://github.com/Soikk/pixel-count) is a small toy program made to solve a CTF problem that counts the number of pixels with a certain RGB value in a PNG image.
- [**wordle-guesser**](https://github.com/Soikk/wordle-guesser) a small command line program that parses options to brute force the possible words that match the wordle instructions.
- [**llist.h**](https://github.com/Soikk/llist.h) is a compact linked list library made in C.
- [**matrix-calculator**](https://github.com/Soikk/matrix-calculator/blob/main/matrix-calculator.c)  a matrix calculator with a console interface that relies on a small (self made) matrix library.
- [**clock**](https://github.com/Soikk/clock) is a simple clock in the console for Windows with some portability to Linux.
- [**wordfinder**](https://github.com/Soikk/wordfinder) is a small C program that finds words in a document from a list.

I am currently working on [**DB**](https://github.com/Soikk/DB).
